** For pc users `set VENV=c:\single-file-python-app\env`
* 5. For mac users run `python3 -m venv $VENV` and pc run `python -m venv %VENV%`
* 6. Update packaging tools in the virtual environmentÂ¶
* It's always a good idea to update to the very latest version of packaging tools because the installed Python bundles only the version that was available   * at the time of its release.

# macOS and Linux
** $VENV/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
# Windows
** %VENV%\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
